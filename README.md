## What is SPARK?

SPARK is an open-source AI platform that combines **multi-provider chat**, a **prompt marketplace**, **real-time voice calls**, **WhatsApp integration**, **AI video/image generation**, and a **complete white-label infrastructure** into a single deployable application.

Think of it as **Poe + Shopify for AI prompts + white-label** -- all in one codebase.

### Four Business Modes in One Platform

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Poe Mode** | Public AI aggregator -- users browse and chat with community prompts |
| **Enterprise Mode** | A manager pays for their team's usage with budget controls and auto-refill |
| **Curator Mode** | Full white-label deployment with custom branding, domains, and commission splits |
| **Freelancer Mode** | Creators sell individual AI prompts as paid products to captive users |

Each mode has its own billing logic, user relationships, and access controls -- all running on the same instance.

---

## Core Features

### AI Providers & Models

SPARK integrates 6 providers through a unified streaming interface with native tool calling:

| Provider | Models | Capabilities |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-5, O1 | Chat, images (DALL-E 3, gpt-image), TTS |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5/4 Sonnet, Haiku | Chat, thinking tokens, prompt caching |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 | Chat, images, video (VEO-3) |
| **xAI** | Grok-2, Grok-4 | Chat |
| **OpenRouter** | 300+ models | Multi-provider gateway |
| **ElevenLabs** | ConvAI, TTS, Scribe | Real-time voice, speech synthesis & recognition |

**Native Tool Calling** across all providers: 8+ built-in tools including image generation, video generation, maps, consciousness analysis, and self-protection mechanisms.

---

### AI Supervision: Dual Watchdog System

A unique two-layer AI behavior monitoring system that ensures prompts stay on-character and conversations stay safe:

**Pre-Watchdog (Synchronous)**
- Intercepts every user message *before* it reaches the AI
- LLM-based evaluation blocks prompt injection, jailbreaks, and off-topic manipulation
- Runs inline -- malicious inputs never reach the AI model

**Post-Watchdog (Asynchronous)**
- Monitors AI responses *after* generation via Dramatiq background tasks
- Detects personality drift, role contradictions, and policy violations
- **4-level hint escalation**: Steering &#8594; Directive &#8594; Override &#8594; Takeover
- **Takeover mode**: After N ignored hints, the watchdog replaces the AI entirely
- **Force-lock**: Permanently locks conversations flagged with "alert" severity
- **Role Coherence Module**: Detects when the AI contradicts its configured personality

Configurable per prompt with presets for interview, coaching, education, and custom modes. Full admin dashboard with event timeline, filters, and audit trail.

---

### Security

SPARK implements defense-in-depth security with multiple independent layers:

**Security Middleware** (1,600+ lines)
- 236+ instant-block patterns (scanners, shells, exploit paths, AWS metadata probes, IoT exploits)
- Progressive blocking: accumulated 404s trigger temporary IP bans
- Dual backend: Redis for multi-worker deployments, in-memory fallback for single-process
- **Automatic Cloudflare WAF escalation**: creates firewall rules for persistent attackers
- Opportunistic cleanup of expired Cloudflare rules
- Smart exemptions for user landing pages
- Admin dashboard with stats, events, and blocked IPs

**Security Guard (LLM-Based Content Moderation)**
- Pre-execution content analysis using a dedicated LLM evaluator
- 4 threat categories: system info extraction, prompt injection, malicious code, jailbreak attempts
- Supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, and xAI as evaluators
- Temperature 0.0 for deterministic classification

**Application Security**
- JWT tokens in HTTPOnly cookies with Redis-backed revocation
- bcrypt + pepper password hashing
- Parameterized SQL queries (no string interpolation)
- Path traversal prevention with `Path.is_relative_to()`
- SSRF protection on all external media URLs
- Decompression bomb protection on file uploads
- Multi-strategy rate limiting across 8+ endpoints (per-IP, per-identifier, per-failure)
- BYOK encryption: AES-128 Fernet with PBKDF2 (100K iterations)
- Admin audit log: every admin action logged with who, what, when, and from where

---

### Prompt Marketplace

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Redis (recommended; optional with in-memory fallback)
- Node.js 18+ (only for AI Landing Page Wizard)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jordicor/sparkAI.git
cd sparkAI

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env -- at minimum: OPENAI_KEY, PEPPER, APP_SECRET_KEY

# Initialize database
python init_db.py

# Run
python app.py
```

Available at `http://localhost:7789`.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core (required)
APP_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
PEPPER=your-pepper-for-hashing

# AI Providers (at least one required)
OPENAI_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_AI_KEY=AI...
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Voice & Speech (optional)
ELEVENLABS_KEY=...
DEEPGRAM_KEY=...

# WhatsApp (optional)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...

# Payments (optional)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID=ca_...

# Security (optional, enhances protection)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=...
```

See `.env.example` for all options.

### Production Deployment

For production with Nginx (authenticated file serving, reverse proxy):

```bash
# See nginx/ directory for configuration examples
# Windows users: Laragon provides Nginx + Redis with minimal setup
```

---

## Configuration

### Redis

When available, Redis powers:
- Rate limiting (multi-strategy, per-endpoint)
- JWT token revocation
- Image access token caching
- Background task queues (Dramatiq)
- Security middleware IP tracking (multi-worker safe)

Without Redis, SPARK falls back to in-memory stores (single-process only).

### Themes

All 13 themes use standardized CSS variables and are **WCAG AA compliant**. To create a new theme, copy `data/static/css/themes/_template.css` and define your color palette.

### Watchdog

Configure per prompt via the admin panel. Presets available for common use cases (interview, coaching, education). Escalation thresholds, takeover behavior, and force-lock severity are all adjustable.

---

## Background & Philosophy

SPARK started as **TestMyPrompt** (2024) -- a tool for testing AI prompt security, born from building a [Santa Claus AI chatbot](https://github.com/jordicor/santa-claus-is-calling) that needed to never break character. The need for forensic logging of where prompts failed evolved into a full platform.

The codebase has areas of intentional over-engineering -- exploring patterns, testing architectural limits, and learning by building. This is a deliberate choice: some systems (like the multi-layer security stack or the watchdog escalation chain) are more complex than strictly necessary because building them was part of the learning process.

It's not a tutorial project. It's a production system that I use daily -- that's how bugs, design flaws, and usability issues get caught and fixed. Development is ongoing: prompt discovery for the marketplace, deeper mobile design passes, and other improvements are actively in progress and will be published as they land.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Areas where help is most needed:

- **Testing**: Basic test suite exists (security, watchdog) -- needs broader coverage
- **Type Hints**: Partial coverage, needs mypy integration
- **API Documentation**: Beyond auto-generated docs
- **New Themes**: Following the `_template.css` pattern

Please open an issue before submitting large changes.
