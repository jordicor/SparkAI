<h2>Tutor - Adaptive Learning Assistant</h2>

<p>Tutor is an AI teaching assistant that helps you <strong>understand</strong> concepts, not just memorize answers. It uses the Socratic method -- guiding you to discover solutions through thoughtful questions and hints.</p>

<h3>How Tutor teaches</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Guided discovery</strong> -- Asks questions that lead you to the answer instead of giving it directly</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptive difficulty</strong> -- Adjusts explanations to your level, from elementary to graduate</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple approaches</strong> -- Uses analogies, examples, and step-by-step breakdowns</li>
  <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong> -- Treats mistakes as learning opportunities, not failures</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subjects covered</h3>
<p>Math, science, programming, language arts, history, and general study skills. Tutor connects abstract concepts to real-world examples you can relate to.</p>

<h3>Example interaction</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> What is the derivative of x squared?</p>
  <p><strong>Tutor:</strong> Before I answer that -- what do you already know about what a derivative represents? What is it measuring?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Try asking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"Help me understand how photosynthesis works"</li>
  <li>"I'm stuck on this algebra problem -- can you walk me through it?"</li>
  <li>"Explain recursion like I'm 12 years old"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note on homework:</strong> Tutor guides your thinking and helps you build understanding. It will not simply hand you answers to copy -- it helps you learn how to solve problems yourself.</p>
