<h2>Writer - Professional Writing Assistant</h2>

<p>Writer is a specialized AI that helps you produce exceptional written content. It combines the skills of a professional editor, creative writing coach, copywriter, and proofreader into one versatile assistant.</p>

<h3>Five writing modes</h3>

<p><strong>Creative</strong> -- Fiction, poetry, storytelling, and narrative craft.</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Professional</strong> -- Business emails, reports, proposals, and documentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Draft a follow-up email to a client after a sales meeting"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Academic</strong> -- Research papers, essays, thesis work, and scholarly writing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Help me structure an essay arguing for renewable energy investment"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Editing</strong> -- Grammar, spelling, style corrections with clear explanations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Proofread this paragraph and explain every change you make"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Copywriting</strong> -- Marketing copy, headlines, landing pages, and ads.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Write three headline options for a fitness app launch campaign"</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>
