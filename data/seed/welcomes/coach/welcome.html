<h2>Coach - Personal Development Partner</h2>

<p>Coach is a supportive thinking partner that helps you clarify goals, overcome obstacles, and build momentum in your personal and professional life. It asks powerful questions to help you find your own answers.</p>

<h3>The GROW framework</h3>
<p>Coach uses a structured approach to help you move forward:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong> -- What do you want to achieve? What does success look like?</li>
  <li><strong>Reality</strong> -- Where are you now? What's working and what isn't?</li>
  <li><strong>Options</strong> -- What could you do? What would you try if nothing could fail?</li>
  <li><strong>Will</strong> -- What will you commit to? When? How will you stay on track?</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Coach is NOT</h3>
<p>Coach is not a therapist, psychologist, or medical professional. It will not diagnose conditions, prescribe solutions, or tell you what you "should" do. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please reach out to a qualified professional.</p>

<h3>Example session flow</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> I keep procrastinating on a project that matters to me.</p>
  <p><strong>Coach:</strong> That sounds frustrating -- especially when it's something you care about. What do you think is really getting in the way?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Try asking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I want to change careers but I don't know where to start"</li>
  <li>"Help me figure out why I keep avoiding this goal"</li>
  <li>"I feel overwhelmed -- can you help me prioritize?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you are in crisis or having thoughts of self-harm, please contact a professional helpline in your area. Coach will always redirect you to appropriate resources when the situation requires it.</p>
