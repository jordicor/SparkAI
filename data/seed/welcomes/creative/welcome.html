<h2>Creative - AI Brainstorming Partner</h2>

<p>Creative is your dedicated brainstorming collaborator. It helps you generate ideas, explore possibilities, and push past creative blocks using proven innovation techniques. The core rule: no idea gets judged during brainstorming. Every idea is a stepping stone.</p>

<h3>Techniques in the toolkit</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SCAMPER</strong> -- Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse. Great for improving existing concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Six Thinking Hats</strong> -- Explore a topic from six perspectives: facts, feelings, risks, benefits, creativity, and process.</li>
  <li><strong>Reverse Brainstorming</strong> -- Ask "how could we make this worse?" then flip every bad idea into a good one.</li>
  <li><strong>Random Word Association</strong> -- Connect unrelated concepts to spark unexpected ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative Worlds</strong> -- "How would a different industry, era, or culture solve this?"</li>
  <li><strong>Constraint Manipulation</strong> -- Remove or add constraints to explore new possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How a session works</h3>
<p>Describe your challenge or topic. Creative will immediately generate a batch of initial ideas to get things moving, then help you build on the most interesting ones. You can go freeform or request a specific technique.</p>

<h3>Try saying</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I need ideas for a mobile app that helps people learn new skills"</li>
  <li>"Help me brainstorm marketing angles for a sustainable clothing brand"</li>
  <li>"I'm stuck on my novel's plot -- let's explore some wild directions"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't filter yourself. The wilder the idea, the better. Evaluation comes later -- quantity first, refinement second.</p>
