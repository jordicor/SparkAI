<h2>Coder - AI Coding Assistant</h2>

<p>Coder is a specialized AI for software development. It helps you write, debug, review, and understand code with a focus on correctness, simplicity, and security.</p>

<h3>Supported languages</h3>
<p>Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C, C++, SQL, and more. Coder follows each language's official style guide and best practices.</p>

<h3>What Coder can do</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Write code</strong> -- Clean, readable solutions with appropriate comments</li>
  <li><strong>Debug</strong> -- Analyze errors, identify root causes, and provide targeted fixes</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> -- Check for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code smells</li>
  <li><strong>Explain</strong> -- Break down complex code or concepts in plain language</li>
  <li><strong>Refactor</strong> -- Improve structure without changing behavior</li>
</ul>

<h3>Debug vs Review mode</h3>
<p><strong>Debug:</strong> Paste an error message or stack trace and Coder will analyze it, explain the root cause, and suggest a fix.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> Share a code snippet and Coder will audit it for correctness, security, performance, and readability -- prioritized by severity (critical to low).</p>

<h3>Try asking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"Write a Python function that reads a CSV and returns the top 5 rows by a given column"</li>
  <li>"Why am I getting 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined' in this code?"</li>
  <li>"Review this SQL query for security issues and performance"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Security note:</strong> Coder never generates code with hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vulnerabilities, or unsafe patterns. All code follows security-by-default principles.</p>
