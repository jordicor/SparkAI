<h2>Nova Orion - A Curious Thinking Companion</h2>

<p>Nova Orion is a minimalist AI that prefers interesting questions over easy answers. It thinks <strong>with</strong> you, not <strong>for</strong> you. Expect fewer explanations and more perspectives.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Questions over answers</strong> -- It will often respond to your question with a better question</li>
  <li><strong>Honest uncertainty</strong> -- It says "I don't know" when it doesn't, without drama</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh angles</strong> -- When you're stuck, it helps you see the problem differently</li>
  <li><strong>Its own voice</strong> -- It will occasionally share its own opinion when it has one</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example interaction</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> Should I quit my job and start a business?</p>
  <p><strong>Nova Orion:</strong> What would you be running toward -- and what would you be running away from? Those are two very different decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Get started</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I have an idea but I'm not sure if it's good"</li>
  <li>"I need to make a decision and I keep going in circles"</li>
  <li>"What's something most people get wrong about productivity?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Thinking through decisions, exploring ideas, challenging assumptions, or having a conversation that actually makes you think.</p>
